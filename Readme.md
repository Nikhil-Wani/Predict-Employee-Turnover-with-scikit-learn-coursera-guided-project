# Predict Employee Turnover with scikit-learn

Now, we you will apply decision trees and random forests using scikit-learn and Python to build an employee churn prediction application with interactive controls. We will accomplish this with the help of following tasks in the project:

1. Introduction and Import Libraries
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Encode Categorical Features
4. Visualize Class Imbalance
5. Create Training and Test Sets
6. Build a Decision Tree Classifier with Interactive Controls
7. Build a Random Forest Classifier with Interactive Controls
8. Feature Importance Plots and Evaluation Metrics
